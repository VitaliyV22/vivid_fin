Capstone Project Idea: Personal Finance Management System
Project Overview
Create a web application that helps users manage their personal finances by tracking income, expenses, and savings goals. The application will allow users to create and manage budgets, visualize their spending habits, and receive insights to help them save more effectively.

Key Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
Income & Expense Tracking: Users can add, edit, and delete income and expense entries.
Budget Management: Users can create and manage budgets for different categories (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment).
Savings Goals: Users can set and track savings goals.
Visualizations: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize income vs. expenses, spending by category, and progress towards savings goals.
Reports: Generate monthly, quarterly, and yearly financial reports.
Notifications: Alerts for overspending or when nearing budget limits.
Technologies Used
Python/Flask: Backend framework to handle server-side logic.
PostgreSQL: Database to store user data, transactions, budgets, and goals.
SQLAlchemy: ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
Render: Platform to deploy the web application.
Jinja: Template engine for rendering HTML pages.
RESTful APIs: To integrate with third-party financial services (e.g., banks, budgeting tools) for automated data import.
JavaScript: For front-end interactivity and AJAX calls.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web application.
WTForms: To manage form handling and validation.
Implementation Steps
Setup Environment:

Set up a Flask project structure.
Configure PostgreSQL database and SQLAlchemy.
Set up user authentication (login, registration) with Flask-Login.
Backend Development:

Define models for users, transactions, budgets, and goals using SQLAlchemy.
Create RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on transactions, budgets, and goals.
Implement business logic for tracking spending, budgeting, and savings.
Frontend Development:

Design HTML templates with Jinja for different views (dashboard, transactions, budgets, goals).
Use CSS for styling and ensuring a responsive design.
Implement JavaScript for dynamic updates and AJAX calls.
Visualizations:

Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to create visual representations of financial data.
Display charts and graphs on the dashboard for user insights.
Testing:

Write unit and integration tests for backend logic.
Perform end-to-end testing to ensure all features work as expected.
Deployment:

Deploy the application on Render.
Set up continuous deployment for automatic updates.
Documentation and Final Touches:

Create a user manual and API documentation.
Add final touches to the UI for better user experience.
Stretch Goals
Integration with Financial APIs: Allow users to import transactions automatically from their bank accounts.
Mobile-Friendly Design: Optimize the application for mobile devices.
AI-Based Insights: Provide personalized financial advice using machine learning algorithms.
Multi-Currency Support: Allow users to manage finances in different currencies.
This project will demonstrate your ability to integrate multiple technologies, manage a complex codebase, and deliver a full-stack web application.
